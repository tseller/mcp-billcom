# mcp-billcom

MCP (Model Context Protocol) server for the AYSO treasurer workflow, wrapping the
**QuickBooks Online** Accounting API and **BILL Divvy / Spend & Expense**.

- Entry point: `src/index.ts` — registers QBO and/or Divvy tools based on available env vars.
- Architecture, env vars, and deploy notes: see [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md).

## QBO tool surface

All QBO tools operate on **already-posted** register entities:

| Area | Tools |
| --- | --- |
| Accounts | `qbo_list_accounts`, `qbo_account_balances` |
| Vendors | `qbo_list_vendors`, `qbo_search_vendors`, `qbo_create_vendor` |
| Purchases | `qbo_list_purchases`, `qbo_get_purchase`, `qbo_create_purchase`, `qbo_update_purchase` |
| Deposits | `qbo_list_deposits`, `qbo_get_deposit`, `qbo_create_deposit`, `qbo_create_deposits_batch`, `qbo_update_deposit` |
| Transfers / Journal | `qbo_list_transfers`, `qbo_create_transfer`, `qbo_create_journal_entry` |
| Reports | `qbo_transaction_report`, `qbo_profit_loss`, `qbo_balance_sheet` |
| Reconcile | `qbo_reconcile_worksheet`, `qbo_cleared_transactions` |
| Attachments | `qbo_list_attachments`, `qbo_attach_file` |

## Known limitation — the QBO "For-Review" bank feed is **not** API-accessible

> **The single biggest chunk of treasurer work — the QBO _Bank transactions → For-Review_
> queue (`qbo.intuit.com/app/banking`, the "Pending" tab) — cannot be read or written by
> any tool in this MCP, because Intuit exposes no API for it.**

When a bank/card feed downloads Chase/Divvy lines, they land in the **For-Review** tab and
**do not affect the books** until a human **Adds** (categorize → post) or **Matches** them.
This staging area is what a treasurer spends most of their time in (~137 Chase lines in one
recent AYSO month).

### Why no tool can touch it

The QuickBooks Online **Accounting API (v3)** only exposes entities that are **already
posted to the register**. It has **no entity, endpoint, or OAuth scope** for downloaded /
pending / For-Review bank-feed lines. Bank feeds run through a **completely separate**
system — Intuit's **Financial Data Partner (FDP)** program over the **OFX** protocol,
intended for *financial institutions* publishing a feed *into* Intuit products, not for apps
reading a customer's review queue.

This is a deliberate, long-standing restriction. Intuit pays per-access aggregation costs
(Plaid/Yodlee/MDX) for that raw bank data and does not re-expose it through the developer
API. Intuit staff and developers have confirmed repeatedly on the developer forum that
fetching For-Review / pending bank-feed transactions via the v3 API **is not possible**.

- [Top 5 QuickBooks API limitations](https://satvasolutions.medium.com/top-5-quickbooks-api-limitations-to-know-before-developing-your-qbo-app-5e76ed89bb8d) — the API exposes only accepted/recorded register transactions, not raw For-Review items.
- [Intuit App Partner Program (2025)](https://report.woodard.com/articles/intuits-app-partner-program-marks-new-phase-in-developer-ecosystem-fpwr) — the 2025 program adds tiers/fees but **no** new bank-feed read/write API surface.

### What is NOT a workaround

- **`qbo_cleared_transactions cleared=Uncleared`** returns *posted* register lines whose
  **reconcile** status is un-cleared. That is a different concept from the For-Review feed —
  those items are already in the books. It does **not** enumerate the review queue.
- **`qbo_create_purchase` / `qbo_create_deposit`** can *book* an equivalent transaction, but
  that creates a **parallel posted entity that does not clear the matching bank-feed line** →
  **double-count risk**. It is not "Add from review."

### Recommended fallbacks (until/unless Intuit ships an API)

1. **Read side — CSV/QBO export from the UI.** The For-Review list can be exported from the
   QBO banking page; feed that file to an MCP tool for read-only enumeration/triage. No API
   dependency; requires a manual export step.
2. **Write side — book-then-match.** Create the posted transaction via the MCP
   (`qbo_create_purchase` / `qbo_create_deposit`), then **Match** it to the feed line in the
   QBO UI (QBO surfaces booked entries as one-click matches — see those tools' descriptions).
   This avoids the double-count but keeps the final Add/Match a manual UI action.
3. **Attachments require a posted item first.** To attach a receipt to a For-Review item,
   **Add it in the UI first**, then use `qbo_attach_file` on the resulting posted transaction
   (exactly the path used for the $700.64 reimbursement in the source journey).
4. **Browser automation** of the QBO banking page is the only way to script Add/Match
   end-to-end; it is brittle (unofficial, UI-coupled) and out of scope for this MCP today.
5. **Bank-direct feed** (a separate Chase/Divvy → tooling pipeline) sidesteps QBO's staging
   entirely, at the cost of building and reconciling a parallel ingestion path.

**Bottom line:** enumerating or Adding/Matching the For-Review queue is **not achievable
through the QBO API**. This MCP intentionally ships no such tool; the practical path remains
UI export (read) + book-then-match (write).
