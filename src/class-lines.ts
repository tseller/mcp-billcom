/**
 * Setting a Class on an existing transaction's lines — WITHOUT rebuilding them.
 *
 * Why this module exists at all:
 *
 * The obvious way to add a class to an existing transaction is to send the
 * update tools a `lines` array with the class on it. That is a trap. Those
 * arrays can express three fields (amount, account, description); a real line
 * in the AYSO books carries up to seven. Measured live across the 389 lines on
 * the 337 transactions since 2026-01-01: every purchase line carries `Id`,
 * `Description`, `TaxCodeRef` AND `BillableStatus` (some also `CustomerRef`),
 * every deposit line carries `Id` + `LineNum` (85 of 91 also `Entity`), every
 * journal-entry line carries `Id` (94 of 100 also `Entity`). Rebuilding lines
 * from a 3-field schema silently throws the rest away.
 *
 * So nothing here rebuilds a line. `applyClassToLines` deep-copies the lines
 * QBO just gave us and writes exactly one property — `ClassRef` — leaving
 * every other byte alone. `diffPaths` exists so that claim is *checkable*
 * rather than merely asserted: the tests (and the tools' own dryRun output)
 * diff the outgoing payload against the incoming one and require that the only
 * paths that differ end in `ClassRef`.
 *
 * Class tracking on this company is PER LINE (`ClassTrackingPerTxnLine: true`,
 * verified live), which is why ClassRef goes on each line's detail object and
 * never on the transaction header.
