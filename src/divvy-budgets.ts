/**
 * The Divvy (BILL Spend & Expense) budget listing, assembled from every source
 * that can name a budget — because BILL's own budget list cannot name them all.
 *
 * Measured against live books on 2026-09-17 (issue #34):
 * `GET /v3/spend/budgets` returns `{"results":[]}` while the same token's
 * transactions name ten budgets and its cards name eleven. It is not a missing
 * parameter and not a malformed request — every documented filter was tried:
 *
 *   (no filter)                              → 0
 *   retired:eq:false                         → 0
 *   retired:eq:true                          → 3 (all retired, all pre-2026)
 *   budgetIds:eq:<an active budget's uuid>   → 0   ← the documented id filter
 *   parentBudgetId / isBudgetGroup / name    → 0
 *   sort=name:asc, sort=spent:desc, max=100  → 0
 *
 * while `GET /v3/spend/budgets/<that same uuid>` returns the budget in full,
 * 200, with its name, limits and current-period spend. So the list endpoint is
 * blind to budgets this token can demonstrably read one at a time. Asking it
 * differently does not fix that; only asking something else does.
 *
 * Hence this module. A budget reference is discovered from the sources that do
 * name budgets — the budget list itself, cards, and recent transactions — and
 * each reference is then read back by id, which is BILL's own confirmation
 * that the budget exists. The result states per source what it contributed, so
 * a listing that is short because a source went blind says so rather than
 * passing off a partial answer as the whole (`src/empty-listing.ts` is the
 * same discipline for the zero-row case).
