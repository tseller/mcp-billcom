/**
 * How BILL pages a list — the spelling, the maximum, and the walk — declared
 * once, in one place.
 *
 * Three facts govern every BILL/Divvy listing, and they lived in five places
 * that agreed with each other nowhere: the query parameter carrying the cursor,
 * the one carrying the page size, and the maximum that second one accepts.
 *
 * Two bugs came out of that, and they are the same bug:
 *
 *  - `divvy_list_transactions` advertised `pageSize` as an unbounded string and
 *    handed it straight to BILL, so `pageSize: "100"` came back as BILL's raw
 *    `400 max: must be less than or equal to 50` (issue #24) — while the tool's
 *    own `BILL_MAX_PAGE_SIZE = 50` sat a few lines away, used for something
 *    else entirely. The limit was known to the code and not to the schema.
 *  - `divvy_list_custom_field_values` spelled those same two parameters `page`
 *    and `page_size`. BILL does not read either name, and answers 200 rather
 *    than rejecting them — so that tool could not page at all. Probed on live
 *    books 2026-09-18: `?page_size=5` returns the same 20 rows as no parameter,
 *    and `?page=<cursor>` returns the FIRST page again, forever.
 *
 * The second is issue #29's shape a fourth time — a parameter sent and assumed.
 * So the spelling is written down here once and every list goes through it; a
 * method can no longer invent a third name for BILL's cursor.
 *
 * Each endpoint's maximum is BILL's own answer, probed rather than assumed
 * (live books, 2026-09-18 — it validates `max`, so the 400 is the boundary):
 *
 *   /v3/spend/transactions            max <= 50    (51 is a 400)
 *   /v3/spend/cards                   max <= 100   (101 is a 400)
 *   /v3/spend/budgets                 max <= 100   (101 is a 400)
 *   /v3/spend/custom-fields/…/values  max <= 100   (101 is a 400)
 *   /v3/spend/custom-fields           max <= 100   (101 is a 400)
 *
 * A caller's `pageSize` is deliberately NOT that maximum. BILL's page is a
 * transport detail; `pageSize` is how many rows the caller wants back. An ask
 * larger than one BILL page is therefore served by walking `nextPage` here —
 * bounded by `MAX_BILL_PAGES_PER_CALL` and by the result-size budget — rather
 * than by a backend 400 the caller has to learn to loop around.
 *
 * Spelling the parameters once is half the fix (issue #33). The other half is
 * that a paging parameter, like a filter, is only real if the answer obeys it —
 * and BILL answers an unknown query parameter with 200 and a page, never a
 * refusal, so being ignored is invisible from the response unless something
 * looks. `FILTER_SPECS` (src/divvy-filters.ts) declares each filter as the term
 * sent and the same question asked of the rows that come back; `PAGING_SPECS`
 * and `PagingCheck` below are that treatment for paging, and `walkBillPages`
 * runs them on every page of every BILL listing rather than per tool. A rename
 * would have fixed the instance and left the next wrong name just as silent.
